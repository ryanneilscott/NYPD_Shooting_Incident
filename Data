## Bringing in the library into my console
library(tidyverse)


## Assigning the NYPD csv file to a variable
NYPD <- read_csv("~/Desktop/Documents/Data Analysis Tools/Projects/RStudio Projects/NYPD/NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data__Historic_.csv")


## Reviewing the column names of the NYPD dataset
head(NYPD, n = 5)


## Reviewing the descriptive statistics and classes of each column
summary(NYPD)


## Removing columns that are not relevant to my analysis
NYPD <- NYPD %>%
     select(-Latitude, -Longitude, -Lon_Lat, -Y_COORD_CD, -X_COORD_CD)


## Changing the Occurance Date column from charater to Date format
NYPD <- NYPD %>%

# Reviewing the data range of the the Occurance date column
date_summary <- NYPD %>%

## Review distinct values of the Boro and Location of Occurance Columns
NYPD %>%

## Grouping occurrences by Borough
borough_counts <- NYPD %>%
